<h1>Design</h1>

## Strategy Plane
While adult english schools in Ireland provide a strict and structured curriculum for students to learn english as a foreign language they often fail to provide the students with the english that is unique to their professional needs and the local english speaking population.

The objective of this project is to give the user the ability to find and sign-up to a course that is aligned to their professional needs.

## Scope Plane
This project will look to provide the ficitous company/school L.E.A.R.N Ltd. a company website.

The website will convey the uniqiness of the services provided to the prospective student and a means to contact the school or sign-up to a course.

## Structure Plane
As the aim of the site is to provide courses and information to the users the site was developed to be a linear multi-page site. The User has access to a navbar at the top of the page which they can use to navigate to any page on the website.

It was also planned to have contact information and access to social media on all pages for ease of use.

## Skeleton Plane
From the structure above I was able to generate the below Wireframes for the site, while these wireframes are guidelines for building the main structure of the site the layout of the content is subject to change.

## Surface Plane

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        The colour scheme I used for the site were taken from the Irish flag I deicided to used this colour scheme to give the site a different look from other school site, the Hex values I used are:

        -   #169B62 - For Green
        -   #f3f3ee - For White
        -   #FF883E - For Orange

        These values were taken from [schemecolor](https://www.schemecolor.com/ireland-flag-colors.php). I deicided to use a different white so it would be easier on the eyes.

    -   #### Typography
        -   I deicided on using Google Fonts Lexend and Roboto throughout the site to have a clean and clear font face.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The hero image and backgroud image on the main page and Contact Us page are from unsplash [Photographer Javier Trueba](https://unsplash.com/@javotrueba?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) and I used this [Hero Image](https://unsplash.com/photos/iQPr1XkF5F0) and [Sign Up Image](https://unsplash.com/photos/y1GTwSUMRUc).

## Code Validation
- #### HTML was validated using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/).

Thankfully the about us page had no issues - The results can be found [index.html](images/home_page.png), [courses.html](images/courses_page.png), [contactus.html](images/contactus_page.png) and [aboutus.html](images/aboutus_page.png).

## Code Validation
- #### HTML was validated using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/). It views Font Awesome in heading tags 'h2' as empty tags and I had used an empty values tag in both my textarea's on the courses page and contact us page. Thankfully the about us page had no issues - The results can be found [index.html](images/home_page.png), [Courses.html](images/courses_page.png), [contactus.html](images/contactus_page.png) and [aboutus.html](images/aboutus_page.png).
- #### CSS was validated using [jigsaw.w3.org](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) please see the Bugs and Fixes section in the README for issues I had with CSS, thankfully I did not have any errors in the validation I did have errors in the implementation - The results can be found [here](images/css.png).
- #### Chromes Developer Tool Lighthouse, this tool highlighted that I was missing the Meta description tag from my site so I have updated the pages to contain this - The desktop audit results can be found [index.html](pdf/desktop_index.pdf), [Courses.html](pdf/desktop_courses.pdf), [contactus.html](pdf/desktop_contactus.pdf) and [aboutus.html](pdf/desktop_aboutus.pdf). <br/>The mobile audit results can be found [index.html](pdf/mobile_index.pdf), [Courses.html](pdf/mobile_courses.pdf), [contactus.html](pdf/mobile_contactus.pdf) and [aboutus.html](pdf/mobile_aboutus.pdf). 

- #### Manual Testing was completed using Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari. Testing included the testing of all navigation links and the responsiveness of the site across these browsers.
